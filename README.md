# 🛠️ Blog Application Backend

This repository contains the **backend REST API** for a Blog Application developed using **Spring Boot**, **Spring Security (JWT)**, **JPA/Hibernate**, and **MySQL**.  
It provides secure user authentication with JWT-based authorization, role-based access control, and password encryption using BCrypt.  
The API supports complete CRUD operations for blog posts, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion, along with structured DTOs, request/response models, and robust exception handling.  
The application follows a layered architecture consisting of **Controller**, **Service**, and **Repository** components, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainability.  
The project uses **Maven** for build automation and adheres to industry-standard coding and validation practices to deliver a scalable and secure backend service.
